<h2>Walkthrough</h2>

<p align="center">
Create two virtual machines, one running Windows 10 (Client), the other running Windows Server (DC) <br/>
<br />
In DC, log in as a domain admin account and create four folders with various permissions: "read-access", "write-access", "no-access", "accounting"  <br/>

<br />
<br />
In Client, attempt to access file shares as a normal user: <br/>

<br />
<br />
Take note of which folders you can access and which you cannot:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
In DC in Active Directory, create a security group called accountants:  <br/>

<br />
<br />
In the account folder created earlier, set these permissions: Group: ‚ÄúACCOUNTANTS‚Äù, Permissions: ‚ÄúRead/Write‚Äù <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/43d76d63-509c-499b-b3a7-c9f27d053fc7" height="80%" width="80%"/>
<br />
<br />
Log out of Client, then in DC, make a user a member of the "ACCOUNTANTS" Security Group <br/>
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2dcfea7-f51c-446f-9328-24d0f0c9ef63" height="80%" width="80%"/>
  <br/>
Sign back into Client as the same user that was made a member of "ACCOUNTANTS" and try to access the "accounting" share. It should now work correctly.
